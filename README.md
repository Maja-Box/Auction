# Auction

Program by Madeleine, Mads and Vee

Welcome to our program, Auction.

Description:

This program simulates an Auction system where clients can bid and the server can handle crashes up to 2 times. 

How to use:

Run the server program three times with numbers 0 to 2 (will be prompted upon server start) to choose a port
for each node.

Thereafter, start as many clients as you want (each in a seperate terminal)

Then type in a number for the bid.

thereafter you can type bid or check to either bid again or check the current state of the auction. 

To crash a node, go into any node and press CTRL+C. 

After a crash, when client tries to bid again, it will result in a error where client will change server.
